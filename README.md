## 🚀 Quickstart

The theme is distributed as a Python wheel file (.whl), the standard binary distribution format for Python packages. Payments and wheel file delivery are handled by Lemon Squeezy, a third-party provider. After purchase, you will receive a wheel containing the theme files.

1. Get the theme at https://readcraft.io/sphinx-clarity-theme.
1. Download the wheel file to the `vendors/` folder.
1. Install wheel using preferred Python package manager. E.g.,
   ```sh
   pip install vendors/sphinx_clarity_theme-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```
1. Update your `conf.py`:
   ```python
   html_theme = "sphinx_clarity_theme"
   ```
