# Customizations

Customize the look and behavior of your {{ project }} documentation quickly using both standard Sphinx settings and theme‑specific options. This section explains each supported customization: layouts, navigation, color palette, dark mode, fonts, headings, footer, and more.

Basic visual assets (logo, favicon, etc.) use standard Sphinx `conf.py` settings such as `html_logo` and `html_favicon`. More specific appearance and functional tweaks live in `html_theme_options` option.
