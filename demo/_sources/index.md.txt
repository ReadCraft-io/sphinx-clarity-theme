# Clarity Theme for Sphinx

Clarity is a modern, fast, and accessible Sphinx theme focused on clean reading experience, excellent typography, and zero-configuration performance. It ships sensible defaults yet stays highly customizable through Tailwind CSS variables and flexible page layouts. Use it for narrative guides, API references, or mixed documentation sites that need to look polished out of the box.
